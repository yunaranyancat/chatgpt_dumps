The CreateFileFromDsCopyFromSharedFile function from the Windows API can be used to create a new file from a shared file on a distributed file system (DFS) share. This function can be used for evasion by a malicious program that wants to create a copy of a file on a DFS share without being detected by security software.

For example, a malicious program could use the CreateFileFromDsCopyFromSharedFile function to create a copy of a malicious executable file on a DFS share, and then execute the copy from the share instead of running the original file. This could allow the program to evade detection by security software that is monitoring the local file system, as the execution of the malicious file would appear to originate from the DFS share, rather than the local file system.

Additionally, the CreateFileFromDsCopyFromSharedFile function can be used to bypass security measures that are based on file path restrictions. For example, if a security policy prohibits the execution of files from certain directories on the local file system, a malicious program could use the CreateFileFromDsCopyFromSharedFile function to create a copy of a malicious file on a DFS share, and then execute the copy from the share. This could allow the program to evade the security policy and run the malicious file.

Overall, the CreateFileFromDsCopyFromSharedFile function from the Windows API can be used for evasion by malicious programs that want to create copies of files on DFS shares and execute them from the share, in order to avoid detection and bypass security restrictions.
