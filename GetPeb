GetPeb is a function in the Windows API that allows a process to retrieve a handle to its process environment block (PEB), which is a data structure that contains information about the process such as its loaded modules and environment variables. This function can be used for malicious purposes because it allows an attacker to gather information about the process, potentially identifying vulnerabilities or weaknesses that can be exploited.

To use GetPeb for malicious purposes, an attacker would first need to gain access to the legitimate process that they want to investigate. They could then use the GetPeb function to retrieve a handle to the process's PEB, and then use the various functions in the Windows API that allow access to the information in the PEB, such as GetProcessHeaps and GetProcessImageFileName, to gather information about the process.

Once the attacker has gathered information about the process, they could use this information to identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses that can be exploited. For example, if the attacker knows which DLLs are loaded by the process, they could search for known vulnerabilities in those DLLs and use those vulnerabilities to compromise the process. They could also use the information to identify which modules or environment variables are used by the process, and potentially manipulate those modules or variables to disrupt the operation of the process.

Overall, GetPeb can be used for malicious purposes because it allows an attacker to gather information about a legitimate process, potentially identifying vulnerabilities or weaknesses that can be exploited. This information can be used to compromise the process or disrupt its operation.
