To relocate a PE (portable executable) file in memory using the RtlImageRvaTo function from the Windows API, you would need to follow these steps:

Use the RtlImageRvaToSection function to retrieve a handle to the section that contains the virtual address (VA) of the relocation table in the PE file.
Use the MapViewOfFileEx function to map the section into memory, which will give you access to the relocation table.
Use the RtlImageRvaToVa function to convert the VA of the relocation table to a pointer to the relocation table in memory.
Use the RtlImageRvaToVa function to convert the VA of each relocation entry in the relocation table to a pointer to the relocation entry in memory.
For each relocation entry, use the RtlImageRvaToVa function to convert the VA of the location to be relocated to a pointer to the location in memory.
Update the value at the pointer to the location in memory to reflect the new relocated address.
Once you have completed these steps, the PE file will be relocated in memory and any external references in the PE file will be resolved to the correct relocated addresses.
